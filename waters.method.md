All samples were analyzed using a UPLC system (Waters) with a Quadruple TOF /MS interface equipped with an ESI source. All analysis using Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm × 1.7 μm).
Solvent A, formic acid/water (0.1:99, v/v), and solvent B, formic acid/acetonitrile (0.1:99, v/v), were used as the mobile phase.
The gradient profile for separation was as follows: 2% of solvent B at 0min, 5% of solvent B at 2 min, 15% of solvent B at 10 min, 25% of solvent B at 15 min, 50% of solvent B at 18 min, 100% of solvent B at 23 min, 2% of solvent B at 25 min, and 2% of solvent B at 30 min.
The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min.
The column temperature was set at 40°C.
A mass range of 50-1200 Da and a collision energy of charge state reorganization mode were used for survey scans.
The analysis method was set to analyze the top 10 most intense ions from the survey scan, and a dynamic exclusion was enabled for 15 s.
