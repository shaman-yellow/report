1. Lack of more detailed usage guidelines. Although reference documentation for the R package is available and reports for examples are provided, there is a lack of more detailed examples and instructions on how to use the workflow as a whole (including installation, specific methods for bridging the various components of the workflow).

2. The need to simplify the workflow involves the analysis platform. The workflow of MCnebula includes 'Feature detection', but its R package does not include this aspect, which is possible because there is already an excellent processing tool in R: XCMS.
