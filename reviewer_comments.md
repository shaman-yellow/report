+ 欠缺算法上的创新性描述。

(The work appears to be a set of R code for data wrangling, i.e. formatting and reorganizing data from other tools, and for data visualization. How generalizable of the code is entirely unclear in the manuscript. The novelty of this work is not clearly described, because many functions discussed in the manuscript are provided by other tools. Is there any novel development of algorithms? If not, is there value in software engineering?)

+ 缺少对方法的科学评估。

("Evaluation" in this manuscript appears to be applications to experimental datasets, without describing what is evaluated. The authors show little academic standard in reporting a computational work. What is the statistical method and its justification in the visualization method? Testing significance in ontology is a mature topic - yet the authors offer no detail on the decision making within the code, and how it's related to prior work.)

+ 开发不成熟、不严谨。

(It is fine to write this as a software paper, even without real novelty in algorithms. The manuscript contains many good ideas, but not developed fully. The authors need to follow scientific conventions and standards to report the work. Visualization does not replace enrichment tests. Data analysis does not replace method evaluation.)

+ 方法依赖多，欠缺独立性。 

(On the one hand, an MCnebula user needs to have solid bioinformatic knowledge and the ability to use several data analyses. On the other hand, I think that this complex workflow will reduce the number of potential users. On the one hand, all the required tools could also be updated, and there will be the uncertainty of whether their outputs will continue to be useful.)
