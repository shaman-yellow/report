METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of 74 ICU patients in a tertiary hospital. Serum LPC, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin (PCT) levels were measured at baseline (day 1 of enrollment) and day 7. The LPC concentrations were compared with inflammatory markers using their absolute levels and relative changes. RESULTS: The LPC concentration on day 7 was significantly lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors (68.45 {$\pm$} 42.36 {$\mu$}mol/L and 99.76 {$\pm$} 73.65 {$\mu$}mol/L; P = .04). A decreased LPC concentration on day 7 to its baseline as well as a sustained high concentration of PCT on day 7 at more than 50\% of its baseline value was useful for predicting the 28-day mortality. Prognostic utility was substantially improved when combined LPC and PCT criteria were applied to 28-day mortality outcome predictions. Furthermore, LPC concentrations increased over time in patients with appropriate antibiotics but not in those with inappropriate antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Serial measurements of LPC help in the prediction of 28-day mortality in ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.},

RESULTS: This method was successfully applied to  quantify the six compounds in rat plasma after oral administration, and showed  good precision, accuracy, reproducibility, and linear regression (r(2){$>$}0.99).  CONCLUSION: The results showed that following the use of the two medicinal  plants, for AU and GP, the values of Cmax markedly increased, and the values of  cmax markedly decreased. It was found that the compatibility of the medicinal  plants might affect their pharmacokinetic properties of their constituents.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The in silico fragmenter MetFrag, launched in 2010, was one of the first approaches combining compound database searching and fragmentation prediction for small molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry data. Since then many new approaches have evolved, as has MetFrag itself. This article details the latest developments to MetFrag and its use in small molecule identification since the original publication. RESULTS: MetFrag has gone through algorithmic and scoring refinements. New features include the retrieval of reference, data source and patent information via ChemSpider and PubChem web services, as well as InChIKey filtering to reduce candidate redundancy due to stereoisomerism. Candidates can be filtered or scored differently based on criteria like occurence of certain elements and/or substructures prior to fragmentation, or presence in so-called "suspect lists". Retention time information can now be calculated either within MetFrag with a sufficient amount of user-provided retention times, or incorporated separately as "user-defined scores" to be included in candidate ranking. The changes to MetFrag were evaluated on the original dataset as well as a dataset of 473 merged high resolution tandem mass spectra (HR-MS/MS) and compared with another open source in silico fragmenter, CFM-ID. Using HR-MS/MS information only, MetFrag2.2 and CFM-ID had 30~and 43~Top 1 ranks, respectively, using PubChem as a database. Including reference and retention information in MetFrag2.2 improved this to 420 and 336 Top~1 ranks with ChemSpider and PubChem (89 and 71~\%), respectively, and even up to 343~Top 1 ranks (PubChem) when combining with CFM-ID. The optimal parameters and weights were verified using three additional datasets of 824 merged HR-MS/MS spectra in total. Further examples are given to demonstrate flexibility of the enhanced features. CONCLUSIONS: In many cases additional information is available from the experimental context to add to small molecule identification, which is especially useful where the mass spectrum alone is not sufficient for candidate selection from a large number of candidates. The results achieved with MetFrag2.2 clearly show the benefit of considering this additional information. The new functions greatly enhance the chance of identification success and have been incorporated into a command line interface in a flexible way designed to be integrated into high throughput workflows. Feedback on the command line version of MetFrag2.2 available at http://c-ruttkies.github.io/MetFrag/ is welcome.},

LPC species were quantified by direct flow-injection electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in serum of 45 patients with mainly alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC is 52.1 (31.7-110.0) {$\mu$}mol/l in serum of patients with CHILD-PUGH score C (decompensated liver cirrhosis) and significantly lower compared to patients with well-compensated disease (CHILD-PUGH score A) with 114.1 (12.3-401.4) {$\mu$}mol/l. Mono- and polyunsaturated LPC are not changed in these groups. Saturated LPC is negatively correlated with the model for end-stage liver disease score, bilirubin and galectin-3 and positively with Quick prothrombin time. Ascites and varices are complications of liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC does, however, not correlate with hepatic venous pressure gradient, ascites volume and variceal size. Unexpectedly, saturated LPC measured in serum of 42 patients declines from 88.4 (27.8-177.5) {$\mu$}mol/l to 72.4 (27.6-141.8) {$\mu$}mol/l shortly after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt implantation. Hepatic vein saturated LPC (82.3 (12.4-161.7) {$\mu$}mol/l) is higher than portal vein levels (78.8 (10.1-161.0) {$\mu$}mol/l) suggesting hepatic release of this lipid species.

Without the true identity of these molecules it is impossible to draw conclusions about the biological mechanisms, pathway relationships and provenance of compounds. The only way at present to address this discrepancy is to use in silico fragmentation software to identify unknown compounds by comparing and ranking theoretical MS/MS fragmentations from target structures to experimental tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). We compared the performance of four publicly available in silico fragmentation algorithms (MetFragCL, CFM-ID, MAGMa+ and MS-FINDER) that participated in the 2016 CASMI challenge. We found that optimizing the use of metadata, weighting factors and the manner of combining different tools eventually defined the ultimate outcomes of each method. We comprehensively analysed how outcomes of different tools could be combined and reached a final success rate of 93\% for the training data, and 87\% for the challenge data, using a combination of MAGMa+, CFM-ID and compound importance information along with MS/MS matching. Matching MS/MS spectra against the MS/MS libraries without using any in silico tool yielded 60\% correct hits, showing that the use of in silico methods is still important.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Metabolites, small molecules that are involved in cellular reactions, provide a direct functional signature of cellular state. Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem mass spectrometry to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Recently, we presented CSI:FingerID for searching in molecular structure databases using tandem mass spectrometry data. CSI:FingerID predicts a molecular fingerprint that encodes the structure of the query compound, then uses this to search a molecular structure database such as PubChem. Scoring of the predicted query fingerprint and deterministic target fingerprints is carried out assuming independence between the molecular properties constituting the fingerprint. Results: We present a scoring that takes into account dependencies between molecular properties. As before, we predict posterior probabilities of molecular properties using machine learning. Dependencies between molecular properties are modeled as a Bayesian tree network; the tree structure is estimated on the fly from the instance data. For each edge, we also estimate the expected covariance between the two random variables. For fixed marginal probabilities, we then estimate conditional probabilities using the known covariance. Now, the corrected posterior probability of each candidate can be computed, and candidates are ranked by this score. Modeling dependencies improves identification rates of CSI:FingerID by 2.85 percentage points. Availability and implementation: The new scoring Bayesian (fixed tree) is integrated into SIRIUS 4.0 (https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/).},

Since the last major update in 2015, MetaboAnalyst has continued to evolve based on user feedback and technological advancements in the field. For this year's update, four new key features have been added to MetaboAnalyst 4.0, including: (1) real-time R command tracking and display coupled with the release of a companion MetaboAnalystR package; (2) a MS Peaks to Pathways module for prediction of pathway activity from untargeted mass spectral data using the mummichog algorithm; (3) a Biomarker Meta-analysis module for robust biomarker identification through the combination of multiple metabolomic datasets and (4) a Network Explorer module for integrative analysis of metabolomics, metagenomics, and/or transcriptomics data. The user interface of MetaboAnalyst 4.0 has been reengineered to provide a more modern look and feel, as well as to give more space and flexibility to introduce new functions. The underlying knowledgebases (compound libraries, metabolite sets, and metabolic pathways) have also been updated based on the latest data from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). A Docker image of MetaboAnalyst is also available to facilitate download and local installation of MetaboAnalyst. MetaboAnalyst 4.0 is freely available at http://metaboanalyst.ca.},

  abstract = {Liver X receptors {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} (LXR{$\alpha$} and LXR{$\beta$}) are nuclear receptors with pivotal roles in the transcriptional control of lipid metabolism. Transcriptional activity of LXRs is induced in response to elevated cellular levels of cholesterol. LXRs bind to and regulate the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in cholesterol absorption, transport, efflux, excretion and conversion to bile acids. The coordinated, tissue-specific actions of the LXR pathway maintain systemic cholesterol homeostasis and regulate immune and inflammatory responses. LXRs also regulate fatty acid metabolism by controlling the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and regulate genes that encode proteins involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation. LXRs exert important effects on the metabolism of phospholipids, which, along with cholesterol, are major constituents of cellular membranes. LXR activation preferentially drives the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids by inducing transcription of the remodelling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3. The ability of the LXR pathway to couple cellular sterol levels with the saturation of fatty acids in membrane phospholipids has implications for several physiological processes, including lipoprotein production, dietary lipid absorption and intestinal stem cell proliferation. Understanding how LXRs regulate membrane composition and function might provide new therapeutic insight into diseases associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and cancer.},

  abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large and diverse class of chemicals of great interest due to their wide commercial applicability, as well  as increasing public concern regarding their adverse impacts. A common  terminology for PFASs was recommended in 2011, including broad categorization and  detailed naming for many PFASs with rather simple molecular structures. Recent  advancements in chemical analysis have enabled identification of a wide variety  of PFASs that are not covered by this common terminology. The resulting  inconsistency in categorizing and naming of PFASs is preventing efficient  assimilation of reported information. This article explores how a combination of  expert knowledge and cheminformatics approaches could help address this challenge  in a systematic manner. First, the "splitPFAS" approach was developed to  systematically subdivide PFASs (for eventual categorization) following a  C(n)F(2n+1)-X-R pattern into their various parts, with a particular focus on 4  PFAS categories where X is CO, SO(2), CH(2) and CH(2)CH(2). Then, the open,  ontology-based "ClassyFire" approach was tested for potential applicability to  categorizing and naming PFASs using five scenarios of original and simplified  structures based on the "splitPFAS" output. This workflow was applied to a set of  770 PFASs from the latest OECD PFAS list. While splitPFAS categorized PFASs as  intended, the ClassyFire results were mixed. These results reveal that open  cheminformatics approaches have the potential to assist in categorizing PFASs in  a consistent manner, while much development is needed for future systematic  naming of PFASs. The "splitPFAS" tool and related code are publicly available,  and include options to extend this proof-of-concept to encompass further PFASs in  the future.},

In the present study, the molecular network (MN) approach and two in  silico annotation tools, network annotation propagation (NAP) and the  hierarchical chemical classification method, ClassyFire, were used to annotate  the metabolites of three Zanthoxylum species, Z. bungeanum, Z. schinifolium and  Z. piperitum.

  abstract = {Urine metabolites are used in many clinical and biomedical studies but usually only for a few classic compounds. Metabolomics detects vastly more metabolic  signals that may be used to precisely define the health status of individuals.  However, many compounds remain unidentified, hampering biochemical conclusions.  Here, we annotate all metabolites detected by two untargeted metabolomic assays,  hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry  and charged surface hybrid (CSH)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry. Over 9,000  unique metabolite signals were detected, of which 42\% triggered MS/MS  fragmentations in data-dependent mode. On the highest Metabolomics Standards  Initiative (MSI) confidence level 1, we identified 175 compounds using authentic  standards with precursor mass, retention time, and MS/MS matching. An additional  578 compounds were annotated by precursor accurate mass and MS/MS matching alone,  MSI level 2, including a novel library specifically geared at acylcarnitines  (CarniBlast). The rest of the metabolome is usually left unannotated. To fill  this gap, we used the in silico fragmentation tool CSI:FingerID and the new NIST  hybrid search to annotate all further compounds (MSI level 3). Testing the  top-ranked metabolites in CSI:Finger ID annotations yielded 40\% accuracy when  applied to the MSI level 1 identified compounds. We classified all MSI level 3  annotations by the NIST hybrid search using the ClassyFire ontology into 21  superclasses that were further distinguished into 184 chemical classes.  ClassyFire annotations showed that the previously unannotated urine metabolome  consists of 28\% derivatives of organic acids, 16\% heterocyclics, and 16\% lipids  as major classes.},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods and in particular random forests are promising approaches for prediction based on high dimensional omics data sets. They provide variable importance measures to rank predictors according to their predictive power. If building a prediction model is the main goal of a study, often a minimal set of variables with good prediction performance is selected. However, if the objective is the identification of involved variables to find active networks and pathways, approaches that aim to select all relevant variables should be preferred. We evaluated several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature elimination (RFE). {$\quad$}In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta. In conclusion, we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings.},

  abstract = {Lysophosphatidylcholines are a group of bioactive lipids heavily investigated in the context of inflammation and atherosclerosis development. While present in plasma during physiological conditions, their concentration can drastically increase in certain inflammatory states. Lysophosphatidylcholines are widely regarded as potent pro-inflammatory and deleterious mediators, but an increasing number of more recent studies show multiple beneficial properties under various pathological conditions. Many of the discrepancies in the published studies are due to the investigation of different species or mixtures of lysophatidylcholines and the use of supra-physiological concentrations in the absence of serum or other carrier proteins. Furthermore, interpretation of the results is complicated by the rapid metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in cells and tissues to pro-inflammatory lysophosphatidic acid. Interestingly, most of the recent studies, in contrast to older studies, found lower LPC plasma levels associated with unfavorable disease outcomes. Being the most abundant lysophospholipid in plasma, it is of utmost importance to understand its physiological functions and shed light on the discordant literature connected to its research. LPCs should be recognized as important homeostatic mediators involved in all stages of vascular inflammation. In this review, we want to point out potential pro- and anti-inflammatory activities of lysophospholipids in the vascular system and highlight recent discoveries about the effect of lysophosphatidylcholines on immune cells at the endothelial vascular interface. We will also look at their potential clinical application as biomarkers.},

On diverse datasets, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at low false discovery rates and outperforms spectral library search. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated 12 natural bile acids. The annotation of nine structures was confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards. In human samples, we annotated and manually validated 315 molecular structures currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Application of COSMIC to data from 17,400 metabolomics experiments led to 1,715 high-confidence structural annotations that were absent from spectral libraries.},

  abstract = {As the major component of cell membranes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized de novo in the Kennedy pathway and then undergoes extensive deacylation-reacylation remodeling via Lands' cycle. The re-acylation is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) and among the four LPCAT members in human, the LPCAT3 preferentially introduces polyunsaturated acyl onto the sn-2 position of lysophosphatidylcholine, thereby modulating the membrane fluidity and membrane protein functions therein. Combining the x-ray crystallography and the cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of LPCAT3 in apo-, acyl donor-bound, and acyl receptor-bound states. A reaction chamber was revealed in the LPCAT3 structure where the lysophosphatidylcholine and arachidonoyl-CoA were positioned in two tunnels connected near to the catalytic center. A side pocket was found expanding the tunnel for the arachidonoyl CoA and holding the main body of arachidonoyl. The structural and functional analysis provides the basis for the re-acylation of lysophosphatidylcholine and the substrate preference during the reactions.},

  abstract = {Metabolites provide a direct functional signature of cellular state. Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem MS to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. We present a method for searching molecular structure databases using tandem MS data of small molecules. Our method computes a fragmentation tree that best explains the fragmentation spectrum of an unknown molecule. We use the fragmentation tree to predict the molecular structure fingerprint of the unknown compound using machine learning. This fingerprint is then used to search a molecular structure database such as PubChem. Our method is shown to improve on the competing methods for computational metabolite identification by a considerable margin.},
