Dear Dr. Wang:

You recently received a Revision Request from Benjamin Garcia.  In addition to addressing the Editor's concerns and the requests of the reviewers, please complete the following before submitting your revision:


- Please provide full contact information for all authors on the cover page of the manuscript file: institution, city, state, postal code, country for each affiliation (states are required for United States addresses only). Postal codes are also required for addresses outside the U.S., for countries that have them. Each separate affiliation requires its own address information - they cannot be combined.

- Periodical references should contain authors surnames followed by initials, article title, all journal names abbreviated, year, volume number, and page range. The chapter on formatting requirements for referencing is available in Author Guidelines, under “Manuscript Text Components” / References section:  https://publish.acs.org/publish/author_guidelines?coden=ancham

- Supporting Information for Publication should be formatted with a title page that includes the headline "Supporting Information" followed by manuscript title, list of authors, authors affiliations and Table of Content. Please correct.

- Supporting Information for Publication pages must be numbered consecutively, starting with cover page as 'S1'.

- If the manuscript is accompanied by any Supporting Information for Publication, the manuscript should contain a brief, non-sentence description of the actual contents of each Supporting Information file. This description should be labeled as 'Supporting Information' and should appear directly before the 'Acknowledgment' and 'Reference' sections.  The appropriate format is as follows:

Supporting Information

 [ Brief statement in non-sentence format of the contents of the material supplied as Supporting Information. ]

    a) Examples of sufficient descriptions: “1H NMR spectra for all compounds...” or “Additional experimental details, materials, and methods, including photographs of experimental setup...”.
  
    b) Examples of insufficient descriptions: “Figures S1-S3...” or “Additional figures as mentioned in the text...” etc.

- Unfortunately, the submitted version of the manuscript greatly exceeds our journal’s page limit guidelines. Experience teaches us those lengthy manuscripts often involve peer review that is slowed and less detailed. The length guidelines (http://pubs.acs.org/page/ancham/submission/authors.html) state a maximum length of 8 journal pages for articles. Based on counting 1000 words per journal page, single-column figures or tables as 250 words and double-column figure or table as 500 words, your paper is about 17.3 pages. Please keep the essential details of the Experimental Section in the main body of the manuscript. To shorten your article to 8 pages, consider placing the more detailed experimental protocols, development of equations, and additional tables / figures in the Supporting Information section.



We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript, so that processing of your manuscript may proceed without further delay.

Be sure that the final versions of your manuscript file and any Supporting Information files intended for publication (including the pdf versions, if provided) are free of all markup elements, such as track changes, comments, colored text, highlights, and sticky notes.

Please include an annotated copy of the manuscript to show revisions and track changes for the benefit of the reviewers.   This marked manuscript should be uploaded electronically in the File Upload section as "Supporting Information for Review Only" during submission of your revision.

Thank you for considering Analytical Chemistry as a forum for the publication of your work.

Sincerely,

Marko Lazic
Analytical Chemistry
