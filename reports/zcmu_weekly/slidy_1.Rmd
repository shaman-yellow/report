## LC-MS: a multi-dimentional data analysis method

+ Main dimention:
    + MS level 1
    + MS level 2

AS MS spectrum fail in ascertaining the molecular scaffold (geometrical or position isomers)

+ Other dimention
    + retention time
    + CCS
    + ...

## A variety range of chromatography condition

# Where is a 'Lazy' method ?

## Extensive method development

+ MS dataset process tool (Integration tool)
    + MZmine2 (recently, MZmine3 update)
    + OpenMS (Python tool)
    + XCMS (R tool)
    + commercial tools……

Publish in Nature (method, biotechnology, communication……):

+ GNPS Monopoly
    + molecular networking (MN)
    + Feature based molecular networking (FBMN)
    + Qmistree, IIMN, ……
+ CompMass
    + MAdial, MSfinder, MRMPROBES/MRMDIFF
+ SIRIUS
    + SIRIUS, ZODIAC, CSI:fingerID, CANOPUS, COSMIC……
+ ……

# What should a lazy analysis be?

## A method:

1. Computational workflow
    + almost computer do all
2. Comprehensive structure database
    + involve all public available database
3. High accuracy
4. Predictive potency
    + compound without MS/MS spectrum library
    + unknown compound should possibly be cover
5. The most intuitive visualization
    + what is the dataset tell us?
6. Fast collating
    + easily collate metadata for identified compound
7. ...

## MCnebula Emerged

![MCnubula](png/gather_child_nebulae.png)

## Inovation

1. Improve the compound prediction accuracy
    + via clustering in classification
    + via considering retention time
    + ...
2. High accuracy classes clustering for MS/MS annotation
    + over 80% accuracy clustering, even unknown compound (no structure information)
3. Intuitive compound classes distribution in network visualization
    + each class involves a sub-nebula to explore the compound annotation
4. MCnebula algorithm integrated in R
    + cover SIRIUS LC-MS workflow analysis into R pipline
5. A wide range of applicability
    + not be confined to metabolome identification
    + not be confined to spectrum library, but structure library

## Recent progress

1. Stat clustering accuracy
2. Stat identification accuracy
3. Simulate isotopes pattern and re-stat accuracy
4. Design re-rank method
5. Prepare public data for further validation
    + format MoNA, MassBank, etc. spectrum data as mgf
    + retention time (simulate)
    + retention time (true positive)

## Sirius accuracy

![top1 and candidates](png/ps_gather_sirius_accuracy_bar.png)

## The premise of improving accuracy

1. Classes prediction accuracy greater than structure prediction
2. Some correct structures are in candidates
3. Chromatography can be implemented into identification

Implementation method

+ Collate candidates from identification
+ Consider structure similarity in a class
+ Integrate retention time (integrate Retip RT prediction)

## An assumption: half truth

Based on SIRIUS identification accuracy, assuming that the half part of top score idicate true results  
Those identified structures are considered as reference compounds
![instance nebula]("png/gather_tt_zoom_34.png")

## Re-rank method

Harf as reference compound

+ Perform Retip learning, then predict all RT of candidates and filter the impossible.
+ Based on structure similarity in a class, perform clustering in this class and get score.
+ Integrate all scores and rerank.

## Implement a new score for re-rank

Structure candidates re-rank score:

$$
S_{re-rank} = ( S_{simi} \times W_{simi} ) + ( S_{cluster} \times W_{cluster} ) + ( S_{RT} \times W_{RT} )
$$
