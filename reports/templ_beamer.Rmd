## Analysis route

1. Data packaging
    + Reading in count-data
    + Organising sample information
    + Organising gene annotations
2. Data pre-processing
    + Transformations from the raw-scale
    + Removing genes that are lowly expressed
    + Normalising gene expression distributions
    + Unsupervised clustering of samples
3. Differential expression analysis
    + Creating a design matrix and contrasts
    + Removing heteroscedascity from count data
    + Fitting linear models for comparisons of interest
    + ...

# Next Schedule

## Gene informatics analysis

+ GEO datasets analysis
